# Astro Starlight On GitHub Pages

> Objectives

Build and deploy an Astro Starlight Documentation site to GitHub Pages.
Explore features and customization - validate its use as reusable template.

## 1. Why Astro?

Astro is a free, open-source option for static site generation that bills itself as _the all-in-one web framework designed for speed_. Three features that make it interesting:
 - Islands architecture - with **zero client-side JS**
 - Plays well with others - **bring your own components**
 - Rich ecosystem - **content focused & community-driven**

This gives you the benefits of performance & flexibility, with rich themes and integrations for quickstart adoption. It's a rising star for JS frameworks and used by industry teams - stability ftw.

## 2. Why Starlight?

Astro has a [large collection of themes](https://astro.build/themes) supporting different site categories and frontend technology components. The ["Official" filter](https://astro.build/themes?search=&categories%5B%5D=official) identifies themes created by the Astro team. [Starlight](https://astro.build/themes/details/starlight/) is the default **documentation focused** framework from Astro, currently in very early release. It promises:
 - fast, accessible, easy-to-use websites
 - site-navigation, search, i18n, SEO support
 - code highlighting, dark mode, easy-to-read typography
 - write in Markdown, MDX or Markdoc

Plus all Astro benefits (e.g., bring your own UI components).

## 3. Quickstart 

1. Verify you have Node.js installed. I use `nvm` and default to the LTS version for Node.js.

    ```bash
    $ nvm use --lts
    Now using node v18.16.0 (npm v9.6.7)
    ```

2. Scaffold out a Starlight project with Astro.

    ```bash
    $ npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
    ```

    As part of setup, you define the destination folder (`website`), install dependencies and configure Typescript, git usage.

3. Preview the default Starlight site.

    ```bash
    $ cd website
    $ npm run dev
    ```

    This runs a dev server on `http://localhost:3001` which watches `src/content` for changes (hot reload).

4. Open the browser to that URL and let's see what we got:

      > A Landing Page (Light Mode)

    ![Starlight Landing Page, Light mode](./static/02-landing-light.png)

      > A Landing Page (Dark Mode)

    ![Starlight Landing Page, Dark mode](./static/01-landing-dark.png)

      > A Documentation Page (Default)

    ![Starlight Documentation Page, Default](./static/03-page-original.png)

      > The Documentation Page Updated (Hot Reload)

    ![Starlight Documentation Page, Updated](./static/04-page-updated.png)

      > The Search Feature (oh-oh!)

    ![Starlight Search Feature, Disabled](./static/05-default-search.png)

4. Alright, let's try to build the **production** version of the site locally.

    ```bash
    $ cd website
    $ npm run build
    ...
    ...
    Finished in 0.13 seconds
    08:53:44 PM [build] 4 page(s) built in 4.61s
    08:53:44 PM [build] Complete!
    ```
5. You'll notice this builds the production version in the `dist` folder. Let's preview it.

    ```bash
    $ npm run preview
    ```
    The output indicates the production server is running at `http://localhost:3000` - let's open that up. You see the same pages as before - but now let's try search. _In fact, let's search for the changed text from above to see if it can be found_.

    > Search for "Related References" in Production

    OMG - it works!! We didn't have to do anything extra to activate search indexes. Basic keyword search out of the box!

4. Deployment

Before we explore deploying the production build to GitHub Pages, let's commit the current version. **Done!**

Now, let's [deploy the Astro Site to GitHub Pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/). Astro provides an official `withastro/action` that should make this easy.

 1. Set `site` and `base` options in `astro.config.js`
 2. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and copy [the provided workflow](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/).
 3. Since we have our site source in the `website/` subfolder (vs. root of repo), uncomment the `with` section of the install steps in workflow and set the `path` to `./website`
 4. Go to the GitHub repo's [Settings > Pages](https://github.com/30DaysOf/astro-starlight-ghpages/settings/pages) configuration. Choose `GitHub Actions` as the Source of your site. 
 
**Commit the changes in your code to GitHub**. You should see the deploy action run. If successful, the GitHub Pages endpoint should show the deployed site.  It's LIVE! [https://30daysof.github.io/astro-starlight-ghpages/](https://30daysof.github.io/astro-starlight-ghpages/)!!


> Issue: Hero links not resolving base path correctly

The "Example Guide" button on the landing page is mapped to "/guides/example/" but when clicked, does not take base prefix (repo path) into account, resulting in a 404. The same route used from the sidebar works just fine. **I am assuming this has to do with the difference in how links are resolved in frontmatter vs. markdown** _Issue raised in community chat. Waiting for response_.
